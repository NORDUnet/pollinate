Description: seed the pseudo random number generator in virtual machines
 This client will connect to one or more Pollen (entropy-as-a-service)
 servers over an (optionally) encrypted connection and retrieve a random
 seed over HTTP or HTTPS.
 This is particularly useful at the first boot of cloud images and in
 virtual machines, to seed a system's random number generator at
 genesis, and is intended to supplement the /etc/init.d/urandom init script.
